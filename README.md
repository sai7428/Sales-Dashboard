# 🧭 Interactive Sales Dashboard for a Mid-Sized Retail Company

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the files for an **interactive sales dashboard** developed as the final project for the *“Visualization and Storytelling”* module.  
The dashboard was built using **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze and visualize the **Supermarket Sales** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales).

The project simulates a real-world business scenario where a **Data Analyst** is tasked with providing clear, actionable insights to help a mid-sized retail company’s decision-makers optimize sales performance.

The dashboard serves multiple stakeholders, including:
- **VP of Sales** – for overall performance tracking
